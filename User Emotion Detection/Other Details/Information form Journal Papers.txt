12.mainly to identify six different emotions on twitter data
13.categorises the words into 80 different categories and the reads the actual data to work on by computing the ratio
14.R statistical learning package cpm is used for this purpose
15.major hurdle is noisy data
16.this break point algorithm can also be applied to retweets also
17.LIWC indicators can be used to forecast the twitter data predicted emotions on the users
18.we must take a step back and look at the changes in the emotions of people when compared to before(before and after the ad campaign)
19.we must not ignore the context, sarcasm and irony of the tweets
20.one could gain confidence on the breakpoint by monitoring it over a period of time
21.can also monitor the rapid change in the trend lines(sharp rise and fall)


::::USER EMOTIONS::::

1.is used for modelling the retweeting behaviour of the users for a respective tweet
2.emotions will effect the retweeting behaviour of the users
3.Obama–McCain Debate is another real time data set for making emotion analysis
4.social, political and cultural trends can be found out with this.
5.TweetFeel and twendz are the websites offering the twitter emotion analysis
6.understanding the retweet mechanism is the most imoortant in user emotion prediction
